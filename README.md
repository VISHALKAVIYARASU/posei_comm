# Java Billing System Mini Project

## Overview

This Java mini project is a simple billing system that combines JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and GUI (Graphical User Interface) to perform basic operations like adding, deleting, and searching for customers and products. The system also generates a bill in PDF format when the print button is clicked. Additionally, it includes a login page with a password for security.

## Features

1. **Login Page:**

   - Search Customer: Allows the user to search for a customer using relevant information.

3. **Product Operations:**
   - Add Product: Allows the user to add a new product to the database.
   - Search Product: Enables the user to search for a product using relevant information.

4. **Bill Generation:**
   - Generates a bill in PDF format when the print button is clicked.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language used for the application.
